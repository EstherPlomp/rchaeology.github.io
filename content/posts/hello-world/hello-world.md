## New Website

To increase our visibility, we have launched a new website (which you have obviously 
already found) using the ['Hello Friend NG'](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) Hugo theme, with some slight tweaks.

{{<figure src="https://giphy.com/gifs/MiniMaison-new-baby-newbaby-birthannoucement-OBnIvqqpKFbZam9Wmj" link="https://giphy.com/gifs/MiniMaison-new-baby-newbaby-birthannoucement-OBnIvqqpKFbZam9Wmj" >}}

## Goals

With this new platform, we aim to provide general resources<!-- link to resources page --> to beginners, as well as more advanced topics 
in archaeology and related disciplines.

## Contribute

You can contribute to the website via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rchaeology/rchaeology.github.io).
