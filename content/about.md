## Rchaeology

Rchaeology is a community of archaeologists who use, and want to learn [R statistical software](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Goals {#goals}

We aspire to make the R programming language accessible to all archaeologists, and provide an open,
welcoming community for all those who are interested in learning.

### Join Us {#join}

clubs, share your experiences (especially difficulties), get help with code issues, and
promote your own R-related research in archaeology.
